Hey there, I'm Uday! 

I solve problems, break things, and <span style="opacity:0.5">(hopefully)</span> learn from them. 

This is my little corner of the internet, where I share my thoughts on software development, technology, my hobbies, and the occasional rabbit holes I wander into. Feel free to reach out for a quick chat!
